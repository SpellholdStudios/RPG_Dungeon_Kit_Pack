## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview

This mod adds to and, in some cases, alters the kits available to a player on the character generation screen.

<details><summary>Original note from the author</summary>
<p>

###### The Kit Pack originally began life in June 2004 when Grey Acumen and others from the RPG Dungeon community between them invited suggestions as to what potential new kits could be added to make the game a more enjoyable experience. Along the way, conjecture on viable kit alterations were also suggested. Eventually, there was enough material to merit a mod being made out of some of the suggestions. Although GA wasn't able to see the fruition of his endeavours, when the collection was made available for continuation, I decided to see what I could do with the set. As such, the first mod version contains some of the more interesting kits that were discussed but it also serves as a consolidation of work that has been taken from the content and made into mods elsewhere. Many people contributed to the launch of the mod but those that have my own personal gratitude are Grey Acumen, Rastor, Sovran, a Wounded Lion and ronin69hof.

#### Notes

*If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run **`setup-rpg-kp.exe`**, un-install all previously installed components and delete the :file_folder: **rpg-kp** folder.*

*When installing or un-installing, **do not close the DOS window** by clicking on the **X** button! Instead, press the **Enter** key whenever instructed to do so.*

*__Disable any antivirus__ or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.*

#### Note for Complete Un-installation

In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely un-install the mod using **`setup-rpg-kp --uninstall`** at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.</br>
